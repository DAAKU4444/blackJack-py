# blackJack-py
A word based blackjack game between two players

Rules for this certain variation of Blackjack:

First player is the player(P) itself while the second player plays as the dealer(D)

The main objective of blackjack is to have more value worth of cards on ur hand than the opponent

21 is the perfect score in which case the opponent also has to match the 21 score to tie the game or lose

Beware though as a score of more than 21 leads to a Bust and an instant defeat

(P) starts first and can either Hit to draw a card in succession, or pass 
If (P) draws cards worth more than 21, then its a Bust for (P)

If (P) draws a perfect 21, then the current turn automatically goes to the (D) who in such a case has to either match the perfect 21 score by constantly
drawing cards, which causes a Push, leading to a tie or else the blackjack is hit by (P) leading to his victory

If (P) decides to Pass, then (D) draws cards in succession and (D) can secure a victory as soon as his score exceeds (P)  (while being under 21)

A note for (D): if (D) scores 21 then (P) is able to draw for a Push even though (D) would have more Score than (P)
